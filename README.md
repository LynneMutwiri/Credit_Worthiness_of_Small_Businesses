## <span style="color:darkred"> Project Overview </span>
This project focuses on utilizing the dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration to develop a predictive model for loan application approval. By analyzing relevant factors and historical loan data, the project aims to create a reliable system that assists the SBA in making informed decisions while minimizing the risk of defaults.
The ultimate goal is to provide the SBA with a robust loan approval model that enhances their ability to make accurate and efficient lending decisions.

<b> Stakeholders: Small Businesses, Government, and Lending institutions such as the SBA </b>
### Project Objectives
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration to identify patterns and trends for accurate loan approval predictions.

2. Develop a robust machine learning model that utilizes the identified patterns and trends to predict loan approval outcomes effectively.

3. Deploy and evaluate the developed machine learning model in the loan approval process of the U.S. Small Business Administration, continuously optimizing its predictive capabilities for informed lending decisions.

### <b> Success Metrics </b>
Accuracy: 85% accuracy which measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions by classifying loan applications as Approved or Rejected.
